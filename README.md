# Quick demonstrations for sample size planning with `pwr` and `simr`

This repository contains the R scripts and data used in a CLARIN-CH & LiRI workshop on statistical power analysis.

We demonstrate two common approaches to planning sample size:

- An **analytic** power analysis using `pwr` (for a repeated-measures ANOVA),
- A **simulation-based** power analysis using `simr` (for a linear mixed-effects model),

which are based on an fictional study example.
